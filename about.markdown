Hello! My name is Zachary McNulty, a student in Applied Computational Mathematical Sciences at University of Washington.
I currently work in the computational neuroscience department at my university studying recurrent neural networks and the
role recurrent feedback loops can play in memory consolidation in the brain. In the past, most of my studies have been focused more
in machine learning and computational biology, but more recently I have found myself really enjoying theoretical math classes. This
website is an attempt to catalog the weird journey that has been my undergraduate education and to hopefully share some of the
awesome mathematics I have gotten to see along the way. Here you can find some projects I have worked on as well as some of the notes
I have from the classes I have taken (e.g. slides, textbook solutions). I hope these may be a resource for some 
aspiring mathematicians like myself. Enjoy and feel free to contact me if you so desire!
